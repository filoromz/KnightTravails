Solving KnightTravails Problem

The following code will solve the famous KnightTravails problem. The problem is as follows:
Given a standard 8x8 chess board, find the minimum number of moves that a Knight chess piece needs to take between two arbitrarily chosen squares.

The solution that I coded uses the Breadth First Search Algorithm. (BFS)

However, the code is written such that there is room for expanding the problem to other chess pieces as well!
Also, we can apply a different board game layout other than the standard chess board.
Finally, there are other ways to solve the KnightsTravails problem using other search algorithms. They can also be implemented just as easily as the BFS version
